# tcping-over-batch
Using TCPing thorugh a preset .bat file for a quick start

To use it, simply run `ping.bat` and follow the input requests.

This repo just use TCPing written by the good people over [elifulkerson.com](https://elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php).
The batch file (for Windows) just set up some default params that I prefer to use when testing my shi\*\*y ADSL, one of which is the option to dump the results in a log file for future reference.

tcping.exe is included in the repo at v0.38. Feel free to check the link above to find the latest version.
