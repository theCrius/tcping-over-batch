# tcping-over-batch
Using TCPing thorugh a preset .bat file for a quick start

This repo just use TCPing written by the good people over [elifulkerson.com](https://elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php).
The batch file (for Windows) just set up some default params that I prefer to use when testing my shi\*\*y ADSL, one of which is the option to dump the results in a log file for future reference.
